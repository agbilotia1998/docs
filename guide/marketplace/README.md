# Introduction

The beta version of the MESG Marketplace lets users buy and sell access to modular application components for limited periods of time.

Reusing these components saves developers significant time in building applications while allowing others in the community to earn tokens for development.

The Marketplace is fully decentralized as it runs on [Ethereum](https://etherscan.io/address/0x0C6e8d0eC4770fDa8A56CD912392d2ff14822952) with a [custom smart contract](https://github.com/mesg-foundation/marketplace) and uses the [MESG Token](https://mesg.com/token/) for purchasing access to services. The source code of the services are also decentralized as they are published on [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/).

The Marketplace is available directly within the MESG Engine but also from the website [marketplace.mesg.com](https://marketplace.mesg.com).
